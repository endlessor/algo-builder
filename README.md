# algorand-builder
Framework to automate development of Algorand Assets and Smart Contracts.

## Objectives

Algorand builder is an trustworthy framework for Algorand dapps (Decentralized Applications). Main goal is to make shipping Algorand applications simple, efficient, and scalable. Think about it as a truffle suite for Algorand. The framework provides following functionality:

+ REPL (console Read-Eval-Print-Loop) to quickly and easily interact with Algorand Standard Assets and Smart Contracts
+ integrated testing framework,
+ helpful boilerplates allowing developers to focus on use-cases rather than code organization, examples
+ algorand devnet
+ tutorials to easy onramp process.

To attract more web developers we plan to build a JavaScript DSL for TEAL with TypeScript bindings (for TEAL inputs). Furthermore we would like to collaborate with SDKs teams to improve the overall development experience and make it ready for enterprise projects. Finally we want to collaborate with Algorand Wallet team to ensure a smooth wallet integration.
